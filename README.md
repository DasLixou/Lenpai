stupidly simple and fast utils for parsing

## How this project started

I liked using [LNodes from Loyc](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/tree/master/Core/Loyc.Syntax/LNodes) but when I stumbled over some problems or improvements that I've been missing I found that the source code wasn't really simple to understand.

So I thought I could make it better and created Lenpai, utils for parsing including a complete Node system inspired from LNodes but recoded from the ground up with focus on simplicity and speed.
